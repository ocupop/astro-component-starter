# Guidelines

An overview of the principles and structure behind this component library.

## Principles

This isn’t a typical component library. It’s a foundation for building fast, accessible, and maintainable websites using web fundamentals.

These principles guide how components are built and maintained:

1. **🧱 Built on Web Fundamentals** — Accessible, semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript only when absolutely needed.
2. **🚀 Bleeding Edge Performance** — Built for the fastest delivery possible: static-rendered, minimal payloads, zero waste.
3. **🧩 Modular by Design** — Small, focused components that can be combined to create anything.
4. **✏️ Controlled Editing** — Developers give editors the right amount of control to create without breaking consistency.

## Components

Components are focused, reusable UI pieces that combine to create larger structures like blocks and pages.  
They should stay minimal, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Components are grouped by purpose:

- **Typography** — Text-based components such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- **Elements** — Standalone interface pieces like buttons, media embeds, and dividers.
- **Wrappers** — Components that hold and arrange other components.
- **Forms** — Inputs, selects, and uploads for collecting user information.
- **Navigation** — Used for moving between pages of the site.

## Blocks

Blocks are built from components to create structured page sections such as heroes and feature grids. Editors build pages from blocks rather than lower-level components. Developers can tailor how each block is edited, from simple locked-down sections to open, flexible layouts.

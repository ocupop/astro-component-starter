# Component Library

Welcome to your component library.

Here you’ll find **examples, documentation, and guidelines** for every component in your design system.

This library helps you:

- Keep designs consistent across pages and sites
- Maintain a single source of truth for your components
- Make it simple to explore, tweak, and extend your system

👉 Use the sidebar to browse components and start exploring.

## Guidelines

This isn’t a typical component library. It’s a foundation for building fast, accessible, and maintainable websites using web fundamentals.

These principles guide how components are built and maintained:

1. **🧱 Built on web fundamentals** — Accessible, semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript only when absolutely needed.
2. **🚀 Bleeding edge performance** — Built for the fastest delivery possible: static-rendered, minimal payloads, zero waste.
3. **🧩 Modular by design** — Small, focused components that can be combined to create anything.
4. **✏️ Controlled editing** — Developers give editors the right amount of control to create without breaking consistency.
5. **🎨 Unbranded & adaptable** — Ships without visual opinion, making it fast to restyle, rebrand, and align with any design direction.

This library is not intended to be a turnkey solution to building websites. It is designed for you to add your own styles and branding, and to enable you to build your own custom Page Sections. 

## Components

Components are focused, reusable UI pieces that combine to create larger sections.

They should stay minimal, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Components are grouped by purpose:

- **Building Blocks** — Foundational UI components designed for reuse within larger structures.
- **Page Sections** — Full-width sections used to assemble complete page layouts.
- **Navigation** — Components that facilitate movement throughout the site, such as headers, menus, and footers.

## CSS

**A note on CSS — Mike to complete.**

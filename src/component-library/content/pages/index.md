## What are components?

Components are focused, reusable UI pieces that combine to create larger sections.

Components are grouped by purpose:

- **Building Blocks** — Foundational UI components designed for reuse within larger structures.
- **Page Sections** — Full-width sections used to assemble complete page layouts.
- **Navigation** — Components that facilitate movement throughout the site, such as headers, menus, and footers.

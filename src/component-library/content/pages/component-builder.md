# Component Builder

Build custom components interactively by dragging building blocks into a sandbox, nesting them, and configuring their properties. Export your component as a complete package with Astro code and CloudCannon configuration files.

## How to Use

1. **Drag components** from the palette on the left into the sandbox on the right
2. **Click components** in the sandbox to edit their properties in the sidebar
3. **Nest components** by dragging them into components that support slots
4. **Rename props** or hardcode values as needed
5. **Export** your component to download a ZIP file with all necessary files
